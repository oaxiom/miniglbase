# miniglbase

Some of the functions in glbase3 are fairly useful in other projects, but we often don't want the slightly excessive overhead of glbase3 in full (I should really optimise the startup of glbase3)

Here, we have a limited set of the geneist functions that seem to get the most usage. Mainly the simple mapping and location manipulation functions
